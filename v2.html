                <p class="mytext ptext">The German V-2 rocket was the world's first large-scale liquid-propellant rocket vehicle, the first long-range ballistic missile, and the ancestor of today's large rockets and launch vehicles. Launched from mobile platforms, the missile had a maximum range of about 320 km (200 miles) and a one-ton warhead. From September 1944 to March 1945, Germany managed to launch more than 3 000 ballistic missiles at the cities of Britain, Belgium, France and the Netherlands. If the anti-aircraft missile system quickly managed to track and shoot down V-1 missiles, it was powerless against ballistics. And As a result of the attack on the town of Tewkesbury in central England, almost 900 people were left without homes, on January 20, 1945. (Pictured Right)

                <p class="mytext ptext">Work on A4 missiles in Peenemünde was resumed in 1939, and in 1942 concrete results were already demanded from von Braun. The missile developed a supersonic speed of almost 6 000 kmph, and could carry about a ton of explosives, and the flight range exceeded 300 kilometers. The first successful missile launch took place on October 3, 1942. Although all further tests failed until June 1944 when a missile rose to a record height of 174.6 km, and became the first artifact to travel into space. In 1933, the Nazis launched a program to develop missiles on liquid fuel. Its leader was a young talented physicist Wernher von Braun, who was finishing his doctoral dissertation in space engineering. His greatest success would be the A4 ballistic missile, which would later become known as the V-2. But at the end of 1937, after a series of unsuccessful launches of its predecessor A3, Wernher decided to postpone work on the missiles of the next series.

            <p>The Nazis created the V2 missile during World War II to counteract the air defense systems of the British. 
              Since the V2 could fly much higher than any previous missiles, it was ideal for dropping bombs from above
               the range of radar systems and maintain the element of surprise.</p>

          <div class="col-6 mb-7 div2 mytext">
            <p>However the V2 missile had several technical issues and failures during its development which prevented it 
              from seeing much success in the war. Although it was a technological marvel, and its impact was limited in WW2
            it paved the way for future rocket ship technology, as one V2 missile reached the edge of space.</p>
